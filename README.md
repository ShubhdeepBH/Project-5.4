# Nand2Tetris Project 5.4: Rectangle Program

This repository contains the submission for **Project 5.4** of the [Nand2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). The goal of this project is to simulate the Hack computer (using **Computer.hdl**) to draw a rectangle on the screen by running the provided rectangle program. The project builds on previous work done in Project 5.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:
1. Load and run the **Computer.hdl** in the Hardware Simulator.
2. Execute the rectangle program script (**ComputerRect.tst**) to draw a rectangle on the screen.
3. Capture a screenshot of the Hardware Simulator showing the rectangle.

## Steps to Complete the Project

### Step 1: Simulate the Computer with Rectangle Program
1. Open the **Hardware Simulator** from the Nand2Tetris tools.
2. Load the `Computer.hdl` file into the simulator.
3. Open the `ComputerRect.tst` file in the Hardware Simulator.
4. Run the simulation to execute the rectangle program.

### Step 2: Verify the Output
- Ensure the program successfully draws a rectangle on the output screen.
- Capture a screenshot of the simulator with the rectangle visible.

### Step 3: Upload to GitHub
1. Open your GitHub repository `nand2tetris-Part1`.
2. Create a new folder (e.g., `Project5.4`) or navigate to the appropriate folder.
3. Upload the captured screenshot of the rectangle program output.

### Step 4: Submit Assignment
1. Click the **Start Assignment** button.
2. Share the GitHub repository link containing your uploaded screenshot.
